# Whois Command For Windows

In Linux, whois command is used to find out the information about a domain, such as the owner of the domain, the ownerâ€™s contact information, and the name servers that the domain is using.

It allows you to perform lookup of owner information of a website by querying databases that store the registered users of a domain or IP address.

But if you try to run the same command on a Windows machine, you will face the following error:

```
 C:\Users\ðŸ¦Š>whois youtube.com
'whois' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

```
